# Hi there! 👋

## About Me
I am a highly motivated AI and Machine Learning professional with a strong background in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Applied Computing at the University of Windsor, where I am expanding my expertise in AI, machine learning, and cloud computing.

I have experience working on real-world AI and ML projects, including bias mitigation in NLP using Graph Neural Networks, stock price prediction using LSTM, and Bangla handwritten digit classification using CNNs. My technical skills include Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud.

In addition to my academic research, I have worked as an AI Prompt Response Writer at Telus Digital and completed an internship at AIUB, where I contributed to AI research and software development.

I am passionate about building AI-driven solutions that solve real-world problems. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science where I can apply my skills to drive innovation and impact.
