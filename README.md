# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a highly motivated AI and Machine Learning professional with a strong background in `Deep Learning`, `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`, `Data Science` and `Cloud AI`. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Applied Computing at the University of Windsor, where I am expanding my expertise in `Advanced Software Engineering Topics`, `Advanced Computing Concepts`, `Advanced System Programming`, `Internet Application and Distributed Systems`, `Networking and Data Security` and `Topics in AI`.

I have experience working on real-world AI and ML projects, including bias mitigation in `NLP` using Graph Neural Networks, stock price prediction using LSTM, and Bangla handwritten digit classification using CNNs. My technical skills include Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SQL, and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.

In addition to my academic research, I have worked as an AI Prompt Response Writer at Telus Digital and completed an internship at AIUB, where I contributed to AI research and software development.

I am passionate about building AI-driven solutions that solve real-world problems. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science where I can apply my skills to drive innovation and impact.
