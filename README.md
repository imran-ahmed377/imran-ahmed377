# Hi there! 👋

## About Me

As a Master of Applied Computing student, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and data science. Throughout my studies and various projects, I have gained experience in programming languages and developed my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software development principles. I am a proactive learner and always looking to improve my skills.

I am particularly interested in how AI and machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems and improve our lives. I am fascinated by the potential of machine learning and deep learning techniques and am excited to learn more about how they can be applied to solve current problems.

As a data science enthusiast, I am also eager to explore how data can be used to drive decision-making and business growth. Through my coursework and projects, I have developed a diverse set of technical skills such as data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, and knowledge extraction. I have worked with a variety of tools like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Weka and am able to work in a team as well as independently.

With my technical skills and enthusiasm for the field, I am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions for the team and to make an impact in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. I am open to entry-level job opportunities and willing to relocate. Open to connecting and exploring possible opportunities.
